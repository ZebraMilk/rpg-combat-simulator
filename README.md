# Async Learning

I set up this project to learn how to use different kinds of async functions in JS. I use FoundryVTT, and am learning API interactions, but this project feels a little more useful to me.

I am still learning how to start projects using webpack and npm, so I am also trying to work those muscles and build good development habits starting at the first steps of a project. It's getting faster!

I have 3 goals for this:

1. Use callback functions to pass dicerolls with a timeout function imitating externally-sourced API calls
2. Convert all the logic to use `new Promise` and `.then()`
3. Convert all the logic to use `async function` and `await`

The UI is pretty basic, loaded in a couple of character avatars and gave them random statistics.
